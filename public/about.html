<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Chris. I studied photography after high school, then did a bunch of nonsense jobs, and now I'm studying to do a fun job that pays way better. Booya!</p>

<p>I'm from New Jersey, which means I am better than you, unless you are also from New Jersey.</p>

<p>I like martial arts and football. Go Eagles!</p>
