<h1>The Best Movies According to Chris (Who Knows Everything and Is Always Right)</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>The themes of perseverence and the battle between cyncicism and hope are things that everyone can relate to.</p>

<h3>Scent of a Woman</h3>
<p>Al Pacino's monologue towards the end of the film may be the greatest speech in the history of cinema. I never tire of hearing it, nor of watching this movie.</p>

<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>A movie about a man failing to realize his potential due to inner fears and the residue of the hand he was dealt early in life, but eventually pushing through to better days. Feels familiar.</p>
